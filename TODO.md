# TODO


- Setup prosemirror again with React ( :DDDD )
- Add simple title editing


- Think through search
  - Title, document text, searchable table text columns
- 
- Think through file tree explorer
  - Can put table row, doc, table in tree.
- Add more table input types (number, document, text{searchable})
- Add table filtering and views
- Add scripting
- References
  - Inline doc refs
  - Table refs
    - Where are table refs set when there's no doc? Can they be set? Probably. Just show it in the table somewhere?
  - Show back/to ref links 
  - Start thinking about adding Extensions
    - Can be coupled with a table somehow
      - Todo schema declaration
      - Todo texteditor block extension view
        - Has actions that update the table
      - How do to query text blocks?
        - Maybe also have a Todo table extension row view
      - Todo would have a reference to the note its created on
- Add markdown editing like Obsidian
